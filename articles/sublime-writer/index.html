      <section class="constrain content"><p>Immediately on its release, I fell in love with iA Writer. Like Clear, Solar, or the now assimilated Sparrow, iA Writer is one of a new generation of apps that strives for focus rather than features. Reading their <a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/" title="Responsive Web Typography, the Basics.">blog</a>, one gets a true sense of just how in depth they went while designing the app.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it can be faster to have your entire workflow within one app, and for me, that app is Sublime Text 2. That&#39;s why I made <a href="https://github.com/paulcpederson/sublime-writer" title="Sublime Writer">Sublime Writer</a>. It gives Sublime Text 2 the beauty of iA Writer when you need to write web content (markdown), but lets you keep your favorite editor color scheme when you need to write code.</p>
<p>Sublime text also has the concept of “Distraction Free” mode (pictured below), which allows you to approximate iA Writer&#39;s terrific “focus” mode. Essentially it enables you to move into a full-screen environment, removing all the chrome of the operating system.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in checking it out, you can find a repo on my <a href="https://github.com/paulcpederson/sublime-writer">github</a> or <a href="/downloads/sublime-writer.zip">download the zip</a>. The GitHub repo has detailed instructions on how to install the theme in Sublime Text 2 (it&#39;s really just adding it to a specific folder). The theme looks best with <a href="http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/">Nitti</a>, a terrific monospace font for reading and writing.</p>
