      <section class="constrain content"><p>Arguably the highpoint of American Art in the 20th century, Abstract Expressionism represented an undeniable paradigm shift in the way the Western art world made and thought about art.</p>
<p>Rooted in Modernism and popularized by the famous Jackson Pollock In the 1940&#39;s, Abstract Expressionism was a new approach to studio art. All at once innovative, phallic, and raw, Ab-Ex generally presented little or no figurative elements, many times relying strictly on the “Painterly Gesture” of the artist.</p>
<p>The impact of Abstract Expressionism goes far deeper than studio art. One of the major contributions of the Abstract Expressionists was their bold and commanding use of color. When I&#39;m stuck choosing colors for a project, I often reference works from this time. Because artists of this movement focused purely on form and process rather than figurative content, their use of color is often very bold and communicative. Below are some of my favorite artists from this period.</p>
<h2>Willem de Kooning</h2>
<p>(door to the river)</p>
<p>Willem de Kooning took color to another level. He worked with paint was very loosely, and he needed the paint to be wet for as long as possible. Because of this, he created very ellaborate color charts which outlined and organized colors by their dry time. This shows in his work as he tends to use colors that are slightly more earthy and desaturated, while still having an amazing presence.</p>
<p>(Gansevoort Street)</p>
<p>(Two Figures)</p>
<p>(Seated Man)</p>
<p>(Mailbox)</p>
<h2>Gerhard Richter</h2>
<h2>Ad Reinhart</h2>
<h2>Jackson Pollock</h2>
