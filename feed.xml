&lt;p&gt;Max Ogden took the stage at Realtime Conf with passion, a love of cats, and a stellar beard. His talk ranged from the node community to the fields that are a frontier for openness. Here are my quickly written notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Node and NPM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node has several non-blocking work-flows for growing the community. Node is pretty figured out at this point, just a handful of fast APIs for common protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPM is where you can put &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. No dependency hell. Any number of people can work on something. This grows a community fast. Thousands and thousands of modules exist in an interrelated ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPM is more interesting that Node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing small modules that have version numbers is important. It helps to distribute maintenance and responsibility. Everybody owns their own chunk. If you have a feature you want in another module, just write your own module with that feature and depend on the original module. In that way, you become the owner of that module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-bash&quot;&gt;$ npm install
$ npm start
$ npm test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three commands should be used in every node module. No coffee, no grunt, no whatever. Just stick to these simple ways of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub has enabled npm and node. There is usually a one-to-one relation to node-modules and GitHub repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have their own federated schooling system. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/&quot;&gt;Node School&lt;/a&gt; is a school that runs offline on your command line. It teaches you all kinds of awesome stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module system allows for dissenting opinions to coexist. This diversity is good and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the best fork win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don‘t like it, fork it. You don’t have to agree. Just implement your feature on a fork. This is a non-blocking work-flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is intuitive if the methods tell you what it is and what they do. If you do it right, your dependents on npm go up. Don‘t call your modules intuitive, let other people do that. You don’t need to market things that are good. They‘ll just become part of everybody’s project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Open World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogden then showed a great chart that diagrammed all the components needed to have something be truly open. This led to identifying some ‘Frontiers of Openness’, or areas of humanity where there is still a lot left to be desired in terms of keeping it open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Science:&lt;/strong&gt; doing fairly well, but needs content freedom. Just look at Aaron Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Data:&lt;/strong&gt; been around long enough that there are a myriad of ways to do it. None of them have really taken off, but there has been a lot of success there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Government:&lt;/strong&gt; People aren‘t even sure if this is a good idea yet. It’s very early. Local government is a way to get around the mistrust of federal government. Talked about Code for America, and Textizen along with lots of other startups who are working to make open government a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should bravely leave their silos and go help the fight of the frontier. Work together to make everything more transparent and open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Realtime Conf 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aralbalkan.com/&quot;&gt;Aral Balkan&lt;/a&gt; gave an awesome talk about data ownership and the future of the open source experience. He covers a lot of ground ranging from Apple, Google, and the NSA to cyborgs and design. I&amp;#39;ve written down the highlights below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Being a Cyborg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we draw the boundaries of our person? Balkan rightly argues that phones and other devices are cybernetic extensions of us. The camera extends your eyes, the phone/text amplifies your voice, the storage and RAM extend your memory. Your device is part of you and extends your abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are cyborgs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What naturally follows is that surveillance is a violation of the person. Eric Schmidt (of Google) said, “If you have something you want somebody to know, maybe you shouldn‘t be doing it in the first place.” Basically, this is total bullshit. Eric does a lot of things he doesn’t want other people to know about, namely masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly Eric doesn&amp;#39;t understand that privacy is about what you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to share. Article 12 protects this. It&amp;#39;s a fundamental right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has always been about services. They have multiple devices, and one login. Same experience on all devices.
Google&amp;#39;s business model is monetizing your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use games as a means to get data. Ingres teaches pedestrian routes. ReCaptcha teaches how to digitize books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End game is to give you services, devices, and connectivity so they have &lt;em&gt;all your data&lt;/em&gt; (to monetize). Google needs you to volunteer all your data. They need your data to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What to Do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to own our ‘digital self’. Unfortunately this is hard. It is quite possible for developers and ‘enthusiasts’, but it is not possible for your grandma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make open source better, and not just the code. We need to think about the experience. Open source software is still feature driven. It must become experience driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware + Software + Connectivity = Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experience is comprised of hardware, software, and connectivity. Open source and indie data projects need to think about all of these elements. In order to provide users (especially non-enthusiast users) a good overall experience, all of these levels are important. We need ‘experience driven’ open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indie Data is empowering regular people to own their own data. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiedata.org/&quot;&gt;Indie Data&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balkan devoted quite a bit of his talk to design. Basically he said three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design is about focus. It&amp;#39;s about saying no no no no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design is not a veneer. Not makeup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design leads development and development informs design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision. Everything is filtered through design vision. We need to understand humans to make things for humans. What sort of things? Things that make their lives better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelink.is/uxtalk&quot;&gt;full UX talk&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#39;re interested in more about ux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://tacma.net/&quot;&gt;Terms and Conditions May Apply&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and teach friends about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are digital serfs, having to rent their services with their data. Let&amp;#39;s build something to free them from that slavery. Let them keep their data &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Balkan is working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://aralbalkan.com/notes/codename-prometheus/&quot;&gt;Codename Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, a project that ambitiously tries to solve all of these problems. I can&amp;#39;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Devicons</title>
      <link>/articles/devicons/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05  Aug 2013 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">/articles/devicons/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work the other day I was thinking out loud about a strategy for generating full-color icons with a web font. Essentially the idea is to use &lt;code&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt; pseudo elements to provide a foreground and background to your icon, thusly giving it three colors. If you&amp;#39;re a visual learner, it works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/devicons/before-after.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People at my work tend to take pipe-dreams very seriously, so it wasn&amp;#39;t all that surprising that one of my co-workers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://atelier-wise.aws.af.cm/&quot;&gt;Nik Wise&lt;/a&gt; was listening to me, and then spent the next ten minutes expertly implementing what I had just imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that this technique is actually far simpler than I first thought it was going to be, and that the most time consuming part of the workflow is building and color separating the icons. Once you&amp;#39;ve exported every layer as an .svg file, you just upload them all to icoMoon (or your web font tool of choice), assign them ligatures (so you can remember their names later), and download the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you just create &lt;code&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt; elements and make their content attribute equal to the corresponding icon. The css ends up looking something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;at_rule&quot;&gt;@&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;font-face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;'devicons'&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;url(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;'fonts/devicons.eot'&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; normal;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; normal;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;class&quot;&gt;.icon-finder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;'devicons'&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;font-feature-settings&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;liga&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;dlig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;text-rendering&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;optimizeLegibility;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;-webkit-font-smoothing&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; antialiased;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hexcolor&quot;&gt;#231F20&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;class&quot;&gt;.icon-finder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; -&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;em;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hexcolor&quot;&gt;#71A0D2&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;finderback&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;class&quot;&gt;.icon-finder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;:after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; -&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;em;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hexcolor&quot;&gt;#E05130&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;finderfront&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rule&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above assumes you set up your webfont with the ligatures “finder”, “finderback”, and “finderfront”, each representing one of the three layers of your icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corresponding html is dead simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;lang-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3 class=&amp;quot;icon-finder&amp;quot;&amp;gt;finder&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulcpederson.github.io/devicons/&quot;&gt;the proof of concept&lt;/a&gt; to see them in action, or look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nikolaswise/devicons&quot;&gt;the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; to see how they&amp;#39;re implemented. Nik has also written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nikolaswise/three-color-icons&quot;&gt;terrific write up&lt;/a&gt; of the technique that goes into much more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abstract Color</title>
      <link>/articles/abstract-color/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2013 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">/articles/abstract-color/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arguably the highpoint of American Art in the 20th century, Abstract Expressionism represented an undeniable paradigm shift in the way the Western art world made and thought about art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract Expressionism was a new approach to studio art. All at once innovative, phallic, and raw, Ab-Ex generally presented little or no figurative elements, many times relying strictly on the “Painterly Gesture” of the artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of Abstract Expressionism goes far deeper than studio art. One of the major contributions of the Abstract Expressionists was their bold and commanding use of color. When I&amp;#39;m stuck choosing colors for a project, I often reference works from this time. Because artists of this movement focused purely on form and process rather than figurative content, their use of color is often very communicative. Below are three of my favorite artists from this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/abstract-color/deKooning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Several Willem de Kooning Pieces&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Clockwise from top-left: Door to the River (1960), Gansevoort Street (1949), Seated Man (1939), Excavation (1950)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Willem de Kooning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willem de Kooning took color to another level. He worked with paint very loosely, and tried to keep the paint wet as long as possible. To that end he endlessly experimented with paint, adding cooking oils, turpentine drips, and endless amounts of medium and thinner. He also created very elaborate color charts which outlined and organized colors by their dry time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obsession with color shows in his work. He often uses warmer, more earthy colors such as Ochre, yellow, Burnt Sienna, and cream, but wasn&amp;#39;t afraid of cool colors, or even pastels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Style is a fraud. I always felt the Greeks were hiding behind their columns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though he has been quoted as saying &lt;em&gt;“Style is a fraud”&lt;/em&gt;, he certainly did have a style all his own. He didn&amp;#39;t hide behind it, it was simply a byproduct of his innovation. Frequently the emotion and timbre of his color choice is what creates such a strong voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color in his work has a life all its own. It is a central figure, almost completely unreliant on composition. Even though much of his work is moderately figurative, his use of color bring an expressive and bold voice to his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/abstract-color/gottlieb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Several Adolph Gottlieb Pieces&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Clockwise from top-left: Blues (1962), Three Discs on Chrome Ground (1969), Transfiguration (1958), Mood (1967)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adolph Gottlieb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolph Gottlieb was an American painter who studied in New York but did most of his work in the Arizona desert. The sense of space in his paintings clearly reflects the immense environment that surrounded him day to day. The vast space he created in his “landscapes” often becomes purely abstract, reduced to its most basic form and color. He is considered one of the first color-field painters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb was a commanding colorist, even though his palettes often include very few colors. Color was especially important in his &lt;em&gt;Burst&lt;/em&gt; series during the early seventies and this period in his career is a terrific cache of commanding and graphic palettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/abstract-color/pollock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Several Pollock Pieces&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Clockwise from top-left: Number 11 (1952), Number 13A (1948), Lavender Mist (1950), Number 12 (1949)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jackson Pollock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best known of the abstract expressionist movement, Jackson Pollock is a commanding character in art history. Separating the man from the legend is difficult, but his use of color generally speaks for itself. Especially in his later work, when color really becomes one of the sole components of the work, his paintings have very compelling palettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollock did not work from color sketches (or sketches of any kind) in his later work, instead trying to paint &lt;em&gt;“from the subconscious”.&lt;/em&gt; His choice of paints was very experimental, ranging from oils to standard house paints. For this reason, the individual colors are sometimes stock from the factory, but the way he has combined them, they become something far different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/abstract-color/cathedral.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathedral Detail&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Cathedral (Detail) - 1957&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of his pieces are more earthy and warm with dark reds, creams, deep yellows, and forest greens, he did produce several works that are much more severe. &lt;em&gt;Cathedral&lt;/em&gt;, a piece Pollock completed in 1947 (detail above), uses bright red, yellow, orange enamel, along with aluminum paint that is bright silver.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sublime Writer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immediately on its release, I fell in love with iA Writer. Like Clear, Solar, or the now assimilated Sparrow, iA Writer is one of a new generation of apps that strives for focus rather than features. Reading their &lt;a href=&quot;http://informationarchitects.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/&quot; title=&quot;Responsive Web Typography, the Basics.&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, one gets a true sense of just how in depth they went while designing the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, it can be faster to have your entire workflow within one app, and for me, that app is Sublime Text 2. That&amp;#39;s why I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulcpederson/sublime-writer&quot; title=&quot;Sublime Writer&quot;&gt;Sublime Writer&lt;/a&gt;. It gives Sublime Text 2 the beauty of iA Writer when you need to write web content (markdown), but lets you keep your favorite editor color scheme when you need to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sublime text also has the concept of “Distraction Free” mode (pictured below), which allows you to approximate iA Writer&amp;#39;s terrific “focus” mode. Essentially it enables you to move into a full-screen environment, removing all the chrome of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/sublime-writer/distraction-free.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Distraction Free Mode&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in checking it out, you can find a repo on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulcpederson/sublime-writer&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. The GitHub repo has detailed instructions on how to install the theme in Sublime Text 2 (it&amp;#39;s really just adding it to a specific folder). The theme looks best with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/&quot;&gt;Nitti&lt;/a&gt;, a terrific monospace font for reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
